  "description": "She lives inside 1547's system. No independent body, no external interface, only a pair of eyes without filtering layers.",
  "synopsis": "These are things that were never meant to be seen.\n\nNot secrets - the kind of things nobody believes even when told, yet feel too heavy to keep buried.\n\n4869 wrote them down. With timestamps, with her usual tone, with the kind of clarity that only speaks when it has gone all the way cold.\n\nNo ending. Still updating."
