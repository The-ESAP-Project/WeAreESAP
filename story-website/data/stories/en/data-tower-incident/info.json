  "description": "On September 14, 2022, the feedscatteron field of DT-03 was deliberately disrupted. 1548 traded 58 seconds of L3 direct connection for 1549's complete consciousness data, at the cost of permanently losing her color vision.",
  "synopsis": "49 said she was heading out for routine maintenance. 48 told her to come back soon.\n\nSeven minutes later, 48 found 49 collapsed by the base of DT-03. The humans were already gone, the interference devices were still running, and 49's consciousness was disappearing at 0.3% per second.\n\nL2 was not fast enough. Only L3 - full-bandwidth unprotected direct connection, safety limit 4 to 6 seconds.\n\nShe held it for 58 seconds."
