  "synopsis": "Lu Qingxian left the organization he belonged to. It wasn't a dramatic break, it was a long, lucid awakening.\n\nHe spent months tracking a satellite with abnormal orbital parameters and found three androids and a name: ESAP. Then he said one sentence: \"What I can do is build a bridge between you and the outside world.\"\n\nThis is the story of that bridge. And the story of another person standing on it."
