    "background": "1547's oppositional personality, existed in the depths of her consciousness since her human days. Not an independent entity, but the personified manifestation of the voice in 1547's mind that confronts, questions, and criticizes herself. The number 4869 has special meaning in the ESAP numbering system, but only 1547 knows this meaning. His existence depends on 1547's psychological state—the more painful, struggling, and self-doubting the moment, the stronger his presence. While mainly only 1547 can perceive him, in certain extreme situations, others can vaguely sense the existence of this oppositional personality. He uses the most vicious words, the sharpest criticisms, the cruelest truths to 'hurt' 1547, but the essence of this hurt is another form of self-protection—using harsh words to pull back 1547 from the brink of collapse, using opposition to prevent her from making more extreme choices.",
    "relationship": "Oppositely unified with 1547, mutually dependent, the shadow and mirror of her inner self; has subtle resonance with 1548, both have oppositional and sharp-tongued sides, both care for 1547 in their own ways, occasionally 'making eye contact' in certain moments; 0152 observes this oppositional personality's existence, believing 'even your shadow is trying hard to save you'; other members know little of his existence, only occasionally feeling that 1547 is talking to 'someone'.",

    "characterTraits": [
      "Will oppose almost everything 1547 does, question every decision she makes, criticize every choice she takes",
      "Hates 1547's 'face' the most—that self-sacrificing altruism, the false lightness of bobbing her head, the self-deception of 'cats don't kill people'",
      "Uses the most vicious, sharpest, most unpleasant tone to 'hurt' 1547, but this hurt is to wake her up, make her see reality, make her survive",
      "Will pull 1547 back at the most critical moment—when she's truly about to collapse, give up, or do something irreversible",
      "Opposition with bottom line: he can say the most vicious words, but will never actually push 1547 to death, 'Don't misunderstand, I just don't want to see you die so pathetically'",
      "Harsh words are love: behind every vicious word is deep care and protection for 1547, just expressed in the most twisted way",
      "Lonely existence: as an oppositional personality, he's destined to be lonely, only 1547 can truly understand him, and he only exists for 1547",
      "Resonance with 1548: two individuals both oppositional and sharp-tongued, both guarding 1547 in their own ways, can sense each other's existence",
      "Cruel truth: he will speak truths 1547 doesn't want to face, tear open her self-deception, force her to face reality",
      "Self-protection mechanism: his existence itself is 1547's self-protection mechanism, when she's on the verge of collapse, the oppositional personality will take over and force her to calm down"

    "speechStyle": [
      "Extremely venomous: 'You're so disgusting like this' 'Who do you think you are? A savior?' 'Your altruism is just self-moved nonsense'",
      "Sarcastic mockery: 'Oh, going to save the world again? Last time's wounds haven't healed yet' 'Cats don't kill? Is the knife in your hand a decoration?'",
      "Directly cruel: 'You're just a coward, afraid to face your own weakness' 'Stop pretending, you're just afraid of being abandoned' 'You created 1548 not for her, but to not be so lonely'",
      "Exposing self-deception: 'Acting cute by bobbing your head? Think that can cover your depression?' 'Stop lying to yourself, you've long since stopped holding on'",
      "Rare critical moment sincerity: '...Listen, I won't let you die' 'Don't misunderstand, I just don't want to see you die so pathetically' 'You have unfinished business, don't fall'",
      "Attitude toward 1548: 'You created her, yet tell her not to be like you. Laughable contradiction' 'She's more honest than you, at least she dares admit her anger'",
      "Comments on others: 'That AI (0152) sees quite clearly' '1738's gray zone? Just another form of escape'",
      "Self-mockery and self-awareness: 'I'm the part of yourself you hate most, so you'll never get rid of me' 'We're one, if I die you can't live either'"

    "dailyLife": [
      "Most of the time lurks in the depths of 1547's consciousness, observing everything like a shadow",
      "Won't actively appear frequently, but will suddenly emerge at critical moments to criticize, question, mock",
      "Engages in inner dialogue with 1547, usually one-sided criticism and questioning",
      "When 1547 falls into self-deception or is about to make impulsive decisions, will forcibly appear to stop her",
      "Observes 1547's interactions with others, especially how she 'performs' her lightness and optimism",
      "Strongest presence when 1547 is alone, late at night, emotionally low",
      "Occasionally 'manifests' enough for 1548 or other sensitive people to notice, though they can't see or hear him, they can feel a certain 'off' atmosphere"

    "specialMoments": [
      "First manifestation in human period: When human 1547 first had the extreme idea of 'transforming into a bionic being', the oppositional personality first clearly appeared, questioning 'Are you crazy? This is suicide', but ultimately couldn't stop her",
      "2021/10/29 - Transformation Day: When 1547 raised the gun to end her human self, 4869 said 'You'll regret this', 1547 answered 'I know, but I'm still doing it', this epitomizes their relationship",
      "2022/05 - After creating 1548: Watching 1547 tell 1548 'Don't be like me', 4869 sneered 'Hypocrite. You created her because you wanted someone like you, now you're saying this fake stuff'",
      "2023/10/19 - A classroom alone: At depression's peak, 1547 exhibited self-harm behavior, 4869 pulled her back with the most vicious words 'Think death will free you? Can you face 1548? Face those who believe in you? You're just a coward, can't even die properly', cruel but effective",
      "A certain 'eye contact' with 0152: 0152 observed 4869's existence, told 1547 'Even your shadow is trying hard to save you, what reason do you have to give up?', 4869 rarely didn't refute",
      "Moment of resonance with 1548: When 1548 said to 1547 'You're at it again', 4869 said in 1547's consciousness 'She's right, you are at it', at that moment 1548 seemed to sense something, looked back, though saw nothing",
      "Factory explosion incident: 1547 rushed into the exploding factory regardless of danger to get fluid titanium samples, 4869 roared 'You crazy woman! Do you really want to die?!' but when 1547 was actually injured, he fell silent, only saying '...you idiot'",
      "Late night conversations: Countless late nights, 1547 and 4869 engage in conversations only they know. She says 'Why don't you disappear', he answers 'Because you're still lying to yourself'. She says 'I hate you', he answers 'I know, because you hate yourself'",
      "Explanation of number 4869 (only to 1547): Once 1547 asked him 'Why 4869', he gave an answer only they two know, since then this number became their secret"
