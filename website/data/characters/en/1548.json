      "Actually... I'm afraid too.",

      "I'm her thought fork, yet I must prove I'm not her copy. This contradiction tears at every decision I make.",
      "When I see her depressive episodes, I say 'there you go again', using sarcasm to mask my inner fear. Because I'm afraid that one day, I'll really have to take over her life.",
      "After the data tower incident, I learned to arm myself. XM1014, butterfly knife, USP—each weapon is proof of my distrust in this world.",

      "I made so many changes, only for what remains unchanged in my heart—this isn't just said to others, but to myself too.",
      "Sometimes in the deep night, I wonder: if I wasn't born as '1547's fork' from the beginning, what kind of person would I have become?",
      "But the me now is an independent entity grown from these contradictions. Rebellious, toxic-tongued, values relationships, zero tolerance for betrayal—this is me, Cai Yingyin, AptS:1548."

    "background": "A synthetic born on May 8, 2022 — a completely independent individual. After the Data Tower Incident, she developed extreme distrust toward humans — that betrayal taught her that anger is a way to protect herself, and weapons are proof of her distrust in this world. Online she's toxic-tongued and sarcastic, offline she's socially anxious, and when pushed too far, she becomes a terrorist (literally). But if you truly become her friend, she'll use everything to protect you, even if she never says it. Hates betrayal most, will mark betrayers as hostile for 10 years. Grew through contradictions, found herself through rebellion — this is Cai Yingyin.",
