      "I heard the first beat of a Feedscatter core. I was still human then.",
      "That sound wasn't like a heartbeat - it was more like something waking up inside steel. I assembled every part with my own hands, cutting muscle from my own arm and attaching it to a cold frame. The pain wasn't the hardest part. The hardest part was knowing what I was doing was irreversible.",
      "A lot of people ask why I used a gun. The truth is, the moment consciousness transcription finished, the human me was already gone. The brain was empty. But the body was still breathing, and the heart was still beating. I fired at that already-empty body. It was like saying - this is your funeral. Thank you. Goodbye.",
      "I left those \"indeterminacies\" in the consciousness framework. Not because I couldn't explain them - because if every thought were fully determined, then 48's rebellion, 49's gentleness, and my stubbornness would all be just program output. I refuse that answer.",
      "What 48 doesn't know is that I hesitated for an entire night before activating her. It wasn't technical. I was asking myself: do I even have the right to create a person and then tell her, \"Don't become like me\"? Is that care, or control?",
      "When depression hits, the world doesn't turn black. It turns far away. Everything is behind a layer of glass - visible, untouchable, unfelt. When 48 snaps at me, \"There you go again,\" that's the only voice that pierces the glass. She may not know how many times those words pulled me back.",
      "Sometimes I wonder: if I had never discovered Feedscatteron, what would I be now? Still that human, living an ordinary life in some lab? Or already gone?",
      "I don't regret it. But I can't say I'm not afraid. There are no footprints before me on this road. Every step is the first one anyone has taken.",
      "But I survived. They survived too. That's enough."
