Traditional chips switch 0 and 1 through electron flow across transistors. Feedscatteron computing encodes information in multi-dimensional quantum states of Feedscatteron particles, then processes them in parallel on Fluid-Titanium-infused silicon. What each Feedscatteron particle carries is not one bit, but an entire quantum-state space."
